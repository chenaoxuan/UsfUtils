# UsfUtils

This is an **open source universal tool library** named **Useful Utils**(UsfUtils) for Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and other Python projects.

The project started on November 16, 2023 and aims to implement functions such as **log management**, **configuration management**, and **file/directory management**.

Some modules of the project refer to practical libraries such as [BasicSR](https://github.com/XPixelGroup/BasicSR.git) and [omegaconf](https://github.com/omry/omegaconf.git), removing redundant functions and retaining only common core modules.
